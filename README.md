## Reflection
This was a 3 day long project. Project goals included using technologies learned up until this point and familiarizing myself with documentation for new features.

Originally I wanted to build an application that allowed users to search different restaurants,showing their images and get feedback about them. I started this process by using the create-react-app boilerplate and setup axios.

One of the main challenges I ran into was how to fetch data using REST Api and how to display it efficiently. This lead me to spend a lot of time on a research, At the end i reached the soultion using Axios and Flatlist.

At the end of the day, the technologies implemented in this project are React, RESTful Api, and a significant amount of VanillaJS, JSX, and CSS. I chose to use the create-react-app boilerplate to minimize initial setup and invest more time in diving into weird technological rabbit holes. In the next iteration I plan on handrolling a webpack.config.js file to more fully understand the build process.
